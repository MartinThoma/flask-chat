# Flask Chat App

This is a super simple chat app written with Flask and jQuery.

## Run it

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ flask db upgrade
$ python app.py
```


## What is missing?

This project is a learning exercise, so a couple of important things might
never come:

* User names / authentication
* Loading only parts of the complete chat log
* Editing of chat massages
* Search
